      "description": "Please join us at Washington Park on Tuesday night for a run! All abilities are welcome and you can run your own pace and length. Like in past meetups, there is generally a mixed crowd that attends, so chances are good you'll find someone to run with.\n\nMeetup Location and Time\n\nWe meetup near the corner of Franklin and Virginia in the parking area of the fire station at the Northeast corner of the park. We start to run promptly at 6:30 PM, so please be on time!\n\nRunning Path and Distance\n\nWe run counterclockwise on the outer gravel trail that follows the perimeter of the park, which is ~2.5 miles. The inner road is also an option at ~2.4 miles. The left lane of the inner road is the path for runners and pedestrians, and avoid the right lane which is for bikes and cars. There are options to cut across the park for a shorter distance. Please review the park map to familiarize yourself with the paths and options.\n\nSafety means sharing the pathway\n\nPlease share the pathway since people use it in both directions. This means not taking up the entire pathway when running in a group or passing. Also, don't be too aggressive on the trail. This is your park to share.\n\nLaps and Pace\n\nSome people run one lap, while others run two...some people even show up early and run a pre-lap before their 2 laps. The group tends to have a wide variety of paces ranging everywhere from jackrabbit 6 minute miles to slow &amp; steady 12 minute miles, but whatever your pace, we welcome you out.\n\nStarting the Run\n\nSometimes the group is large so staggering your start is essential. If you think you're a speedy fast runner please start out first. If you're not sure, please wait.\n\nInformal Pace Groups\n\nWe do not formally organize pace groups. If you want to run with someone, please introduce yourself on the event webpage or before the run. Generally, we follow the model that one naturally falls into a pace group. While in that pace group introduce yourself to start a conversation. Unfortunately, not everyone will find someone to run with depending on the night. People commonly run alone, but socialize before or after laps at the park and at the pub. Overall, don't be shy! Feel open to introducing yourself if you are new, and existing people please introduce yourself to start new conversations. Meetup groups are what you make of it.\n\nWe Run in Most Weather\n\nWe will run in most weather. Please use your own discretion for example avoiding running in lightning. But we have run in -10 degree temps, and rain, and snow, so expect someone to be there for the run.\n\nTrail conditions and Gear\n\nThe trails might be clear, muddy, snowy, icy, etc., so make sure to wear the proper equipment. In icy and snowy conditions you should consider Yak Traks or Micro Spikes or a trail shoe with more traction, and in mud consider waterproof shoes. The inner road will be more clear usually than the outer trail, so that is always an option.\n\nDepending on the weather wear the appropriate clothing and layers. In wet or cold weather, you might consider a change for after the run.\n\nIf it is dark or becomes dark during the run, it is recommended to wear a headlamp or have a small flashlight because the park lighting is not always sufficient.\n\nRecovery after the Run (the pub visit)\n\nAfter the run many of us regroup next to the fire station and then visit a pub! We run and hang around the park for about an hour, but usually in cold weather people head immediately to the pub. So, if you don't see anyone after the run, we are at the pub because we are anxious to warm-up and/or hangout.\n\nThe pub location is announced before the run. Feel free to ask anyone for directions if you are uncertain about the location. As the group has gotten bigger we have a more informal visit to the pub. We sometimes have a combined table, while other times we have multiple tables, or mingle at the bar. Nonetheless, this is a great time to meet people and hang out!\n\nAnimal Friends\n\nFeel free to bring your dogs. Just be aware of leash laws and controlling your animal on the path, etc.\n\nParking\n\nThere is plenty of street parking available adjacent to the fire station/park on both sides of Franklin and east of Franklin on Virginia.\n\nIt's free...\n\nThe run has always been free, however, any donations are greatly appreciated to cover the hosting fees for the group. Or feel free to buy me a beer!",

      "description": "Please join us at Washington Park on Tuesday night for a run! All abilities are welcome and you can run your own pace and length. Like in past meetups, there is generally a mixed crowd that attends, so chances are good you'll find someone to run with.\n\nMeetup Location and Time\n\nWe meetup near the corner of Franklin and Virginia in the parking area of the fire station at the Northeast corner of the park. We start to run promptly at 6:30 PM, so please be on time!\n\nRunning Path and Distance\n\nWe run counterclockwise on the outer gravel trail that follows the perimeter of the park, which is ~2.5 miles. The inner road is also an option at ~2.4 miles. The left lane of the inner road is the path for runners and pedestrians, and avoid the right lane which is for bikes and cars. There are options to cut across the park for a shorter distance. Please review the park map to familiarize yourself with the paths and options.\n\nSafety means sharing the pathway\n\nPlease share the pathway since people use it in both directions. This means not taking up the entire pathway when running in a group or passing. Also, don't be too aggressive on the trail. This is your park to share.\n\nLaps and Pace\n\nSome people run one lap, while others run two...some people even show up early and run a pre-lap before their 2 laps. The group tends to have a wide variety of paces ranging everywhere from jackrabbit 6 minute miles to slow &amp; steady 12 minute miles, but whatever your pace, we welcome you out.\n\nStarting the Run\n\nSometimes the group is large so staggering your start is essential. If you think you're a speedy fast runner please start out first. If you're not sure, please wait.\n\nInformal Pace Groups\n\nWe do not formally organize pace groups. If you want to run with someone, please introduce yourself on the event webpage or before the run. Generally, we follow the model that one naturally falls into a pace group. While in that pace group introduce yourself to start a conversation. Unfortunately, not everyone will find someone to run with depending on the night. People commonly run alone, but socialize before or after laps at the park and at the pub. Overall, don't be shy! Feel open to introducing yourself if you are new, and existing people please introduce yourself to start new conversations. Meetup groups are what you make of it.\n\nWe Run in Most Weather\n\nWe will run in most weather. Please use your own discretion for example avoiding running in lightning. But we have run in -10 degree temps, and rain, and snow, so expect someone to be there for the run.\n\nTrail conditions and Gear\n\nThe trails might be clear, muddy, snowy, icy, etc., so make sure to wear the proper equipment. In icy and snowy conditions you should consider Yak Traks or Micro Spikes or a trail shoe with more traction, and in mud consider waterproof shoes. The inner road will be more clear usually than the outer trail, so that is always an option.\n\nDepending on the weather wear the appropriate clothing and layers. In wet or cold weather, you might consider a change for after the run.\n\nIf it is dark or becomes dark during the run, it is recommended to wear a headlamp or have a small flashlight because the park lighting is not always sufficient.\n\nRecovery after the Run (the pub visit)\n\nAfter the run many of us regroup next to the fire station and then visit a pub! We run and hang around the park for about an hour, but usually in cold weather people head immediately to the pub. So, if you don't see anyone after the run, we are at the pub because we are anxious to warm-up and/or hangout.\n\nThe pub location is announced before the run. Feel free to ask anyone for directions if you are uncertain about the location. As the group has gotten bigger we have a more informal visit to the pub. We sometimes have a combined table, while other times we have multiple tables, or mingle at the bar. Nonetheless, this is a great time to meet people and hang out!\n\nAnimal Friends\n\nFeel free to bring your dogs. Just be aware of leash laws and controlling your animal on the path, etc.\n\nParking\n\nThere is plenty of street parking available adjacent to the fire station/park on both sides of Franklin and east of Franklin on Virginia.\n\nIt's free...\n\nThe run has always been free, however, any donations are greatly appreciated to cover the hosting fees for the group. Or feel free to buy me a beer!",

A rich spectrum of music genres: R&amp;B, country, rock, Latin, blues, jazz, children’s and more!Relaxed, open lawn settingLocal food vendorsState-of-the-art sound and lighting.\n\nEasily accessible location near public transportation and bike paths\n\nLevitt Link:\n\nhttp://levittdenver.org/rules-regulations/\n\nhttps://www.prekindle.com/find-tickets/id/24898848867715481\n\nDRAGONDEER\n\nDragondeer is a psych-blues band from Denver, Colorado whose singular, reverb drenched take on old school blues and soul coupled with inspired improvisation has the band making fans in roots circles as well as indie clubs across Colorado and beyond.\n\nDragondeer recently recorded with producer Mark Howard (Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Tom Waits, Anders Osborne) in California's storied Topanga Canyon and will be releasing music from those sessions throughout 2017.\n\nDragondeer has shared the stage with Shakey Graves, Drive By Truckers, Futurebirds, The Entrance Band, The Bright Light Social Hour, Hot Buttered Rum, Murder City Devils, Anders Osborne, Jerry Joseph, Sonny Landreth, J Roddy Walston, Linda Perhacs, Jarekus Singleton, Leon Russell, Steel Pulse, and Wovenhand +\n\nThe band has performed all over the United States and abroad with performance slots at festivals including: Telluride Blues &amp; Brews Festival, Nacarubi Music Festival in Big Sur, California, Tour De Fat, South Park Music Festival, SXSW[masked], The Denver Post Underground Music Showcase (The UMS), Jazz Aspen Snowmass Festival, T-Bois Blues Festival in Louisiana, Arise Music Festival, The 24th Annual Grolsch Blues Festival in Schöppingen, Germany, and an appearance at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater.\n\n\"Dragondeer is great for day drinking and fishing next to the swamp while gators sunbathe near you and your ex-boyfriend is blowing up your phone with angry texts you’re ignoring in between pulls of whiskey. It’s music for wandering down South Broadway in the summer, sticky with sweat, searching for the nearest party. Really, though, it’s bluesy and forceful, and you’ll wonder why you don’t have Dragondeer in heavy rotation after hearing Eric Halborg’s vocal chops.\"\n-Westword\n\n\"Dragondeer delve into some swampy blues and reverb-drenched psych folk. You don't want to miss Dragondeer's cosmic blues\"\n- Westword\n\n\"Nestled somewhere between the quicksilver psychedelia of the '60s and bone-thumpin' blues from Mississippi's yesteryear, these Colorado cats have crafted a sound that is equal parts cosmic and grooving\"\n- Break Thru Radio\n\n\"To close the festival, the psychedelic blues band Dragondeer from Denver. For them also the first time in Europe and what a discovery. They have completely their own style that alternates between symphonic rockblues and psychedelics. Fantastic!! They turn the music into sound pictures, atmospheric, catchy. Very, very original. Casey Sidwell, bassist plays and grooved as if his life depends on it, he sends his bass lines to the whole band. Singer Eric Halborg has a beautiful voice and plays particularly well on the harmonica. This instrument has an important role, but does not dominate. Cole Rudy gets the most strange sounds from his electric mandolin and lap steel, plaintive and sometimes screaming. Although they occur at the end and many festival goers are tired (the festival began at 14:00), they keep everyone who hears them there till the very end. One of the most surprising bands of the entire festival. Hats off !!\n- Netherlands based BluesMagazine review of the May 2015 performance at Germany's 24th Annual Grolsch Blues Festival\n\n\"This record has a great old-school feel!\"\n- David Gans (Musician and 30 year host of the nationally syndicated radio show The Grateful Dead Hour and co-host of Sirius-XM's Grateful Dead Channel \"Tales from the Golden Road\")\n\n\"Modern-edged bluesmen a la Jack White and Black Keys, this Denver-based quartet aren't interested in retreading the past; they put their own psych-folk stamp on it. \"Don't That Feel Good\" is a folk-blues outing with cool percussion choices that sound like spoons, shells, and tin cans. A cover of \"Messin' With the Kid\" spreads some psych-rock wah-pedal sauce, gobs of lead-vocal reverb and a dizzying guitar solo for a song that'd suit a Guy Ritchie trailer. \"Castaway,\" with its husky vocal, convincingly channels a midnight hobo-camp intimacy. An excellent addition to any festival right now, it'll be interesting to see how Dragondeer builds upon its alternative \"shot 'n beer (with a hit o' acid)\" vision.\"\n- Music Connection Magazine\n\n“Don’t That Feel Good” intoxicates with reverbs that transport the listener to a funky, psychedelic bayou wonderland. The five songs overflow with a remarkable storyteller’s ability to draw a listener in, completely enraptured by the momentum of an energetic blues style.\"\n- Telluride Daily Planet\n\nSTRANGE AMERICANS\n\nIt’s the kind of music that the Carhartt-wearing, hard-working, industrial beer-drinking, regular Americans would listen to — the ones who could end up on an episode of TV’s Dirty Jobs. It’s a little raw, a bit loud, unapologetic and honest. It’s Americana rock and roll and it’s something that Denver’s Strange Americans are crafting with both brawn and finesse, like a hot rod mechanic bringing back an old barn find.\n\nIn a sense, Strange Americans are rescuing something from the rust pile — straight-forward, no frills rock and roll, and a matching aesthetic that is heavy on songwriting and storytelling, but presented with reverb-drenched punch and passion — the way The Band or Crazy Horse would have done it.\n\nStrange Americans have two full length records, Royal Battle (2012), and That Kind of Luster (2014), along with the 7″ Vinyl Places (2015). Borrow You, Brother is the next full length album expected in the near future and recorded with Echo Lab engineer and producer Matt Pence (Centro-matic, Justin Townes Earle).",

      "description": "Please join us at Washington Park on Tuesday night for a run! All abilities are welcome and you can run your own pace and length. Like in past meetups, there is generally a mixed crowd that attends, so chances are good you'll find someone to run with.\n\nMeetup Location and Time\n\nWe meetup near the corner of Franklin and Virginia in the parking area of the fire station at the Northeast corner of the park. We start to run promptly at 6:30 PM, so please be on time!\n\nRunning Path and Distance\n\nWe run counterclockwise on the outer gravel trail that follows the perimeter of the park, which is ~2.5 miles. The inner road is also an option at ~2.4 miles. The left lane of the inner road is the path for runners and pedestrians, and avoid the right lane which is for bikes and cars. There are options to cut across the park for a shorter distance. Please review the park map to familiarize yourself with the paths and options.\n\nSafety means sharing the pathway\n\nPlease share the pathway since people use it in both directions. This means not taking up the entire pathway when running in a group or passing. Also, don't be too aggressive on the trail. This is your park to share.\n\nLaps and Pace\n\nSome people run one lap, while others run two...some people even show up early and run a pre-lap before their 2 laps. The group tends to have a wide variety of paces ranging everywhere from jackrabbit 6 minute miles to slow &amp; steady 12 minute miles, but whatever your pace, we welcome you out.\n\nStarting the Run\n\nSometimes the group is large so staggering your start is essential. If you think you're a speedy fast runner please start out first. If you're not sure, please wait.\n\nInformal Pace Groups\n\nWe do not formally organize pace groups. If you want to run with someone, please introduce yourself on the event webpage or before the run. Generally, we follow the model that one naturally falls into a pace group. While in that pace group introduce yourself to start a conversation. Unfortunately, not everyone will find someone to run with depending on the night. People commonly run alone, but socialize before or after laps at the park and at the pub. Overall, don't be shy! Feel open to introducing yourself if you are new, and existing people please introduce yourself to start new conversations. Meetup groups are what you make of it.\n\nWe Run in Most Weather\n\nWe will run in most weather. Please use your own discretion for example avoiding running in lightning. But we have run in -10 degree temps, and rain, and snow, so expect someone to be there for the run.\n\nTrail conditions and Gear\n\nThe trails might be clear, muddy, snowy, icy, etc., so make sure to wear the proper equipment. In icy and snowy conditions you should consider Yak Traks or Micro Spikes or a trail shoe with more traction, and in mud consider waterproof shoes. The inner road will be more clear usually than the outer trail, so that is always an option.\n\nDepending on the weather wear the appropriate clothing and layers. In wet or cold weather, you might consider a change for after the run.\n\nIf it is dark or becomes dark during the run, it is recommended to wear a headlamp or have a small flashlight because the park lighting is not always sufficient.\n\nRecovery after the Run (the pub visit)\n\nAfter the run many of us regroup next to the fire station and then visit a pub! We run and hang around the park for about an hour, but usually in cold weather people head immediately to the pub. So, if you don't see anyone after the run, we are at the pub because we are anxious to warm-up and/or hangout.\n\nThe pub location is announced before the run. Feel free to ask anyone for directions if you are uncertain about the location. As the group has gotten bigger we have a more informal visit to the pub. We sometimes have a combined table, while other times we have multiple tables, or mingle at the bar. Nonetheless, this is a great time to meet people and hang out!\n\nAnimal Friends\n\nFeel free to bring your dogs. Just be aware of leash laws and controlling your animal on the path, etc.\n\nParking\n\nThere is plenty of street parking available adjacent to the fire station/park on both sides of Franklin and east of Franklin on Virginia.\n\nIt's free...\n\nThe run has always been free, however, any donations are greatly appreciated to cover the hosting fees for the group. Or feel free to buy me a beer!",

We will keep the earlier time for one more week because odds are always more in our favor to get seated on the patio, the earlier we arrive at Bacon Social House!\n\nPlease join us Saturday for an hour run at Rocky Mountain Lake Park; options include loops around the lake or after a loop around the lake heading West along W 48th Ave South Dr to Berkeley Lake and doing a loop around it as well. For those who are faster, you can cross Sheridan on the western side of Berkeley Lake &amp; check out Lakeside Amusement Park. For those looking for extra miles, you can run South to 26th Ave &amp; you can run around Sloans Lake. Everyone runs at their own pace for an hour and then we will meet back at the parking lot at 9am &amp; go to brunch at Bacon Social House - 2434 W 44th Ave, Denver 80211 (South side of 44th between Alcott &amp; Zuni).
