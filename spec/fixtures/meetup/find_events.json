Green rides generally have a social aspect at the end of the ride.<br/>Pace - Average pace on flat terrain is 10-13 mph.<br/>Terrain - Relatively flat; small hills</p> <p>BLUE:<br/>These rides are for more experienced riders.<br/>Pace - Average pace on flat terrain is 13-17mph.<br/>Terrain - Variable; May include some steep and/or prolonged climbs.</p> <p>BLACK:<br/>These rides are for the most experienced riders. <br/>Pace - Average pace on flat terrain is 17-20 mph.<br/>Terrain - Variable; often includes steep and/or prolonged climbs.</p> <p><b><br/><i>Are rides ever cancelled due to weather?</i></b></p> <p>A rider’s safety is always important. If temperatures are forecasted to be 40 degrees or colder the ride will be cancelled. The ride will also be cancelled if the pavement is wet due to rain or slick due to freezing temperatures. If in doubt, check the ride on the OUTspokin' Calendar before departing for your ride or contact the assigned ride leaders listed for the ride. You can also email [masked].</p> <p><br/><b><i><br/>Additional Information...</i></b></p> <p>Our rides are also posted on the OUTspokin' website (<a href=\"http://www.outspokin.org/rides\"><a href=\"http://www.outspokin.org/rides\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.outspokin.org/rides</a></a>). </p> <p>To ride with OUTspokin', you should be a member.  This small membership fee from our riders is collected to  cover the cost of team liability insurance, which offers “members” partial coverage if anything should happen during the ride; we also absorb the costs of web hosting, e-mail communications, providing custom team jerseys at cost, and participation in PrideFest and other social events. OUTspokin' also works with various sponsors to provide discounts to members. Membership purchases are for the season; therefore, memberships will expire on January 1st of the following year. To purchase a membership, go to the OUTspokin' <a href=\"http://www.outspokin.org/store\">store </a>page <a href=\"http://www.outspokin.org/store\">(<a href=\"http://www.outspokin.org/store\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.outspokin.org/store</a>).</a></p> <p>OUTspokin's bike riding program, is organized and led by volunteers. We hope you have an enjoyable and safe cycling experience, and find rides that suit your riding style and fitness level. </p> <p>You are responsible for your own decisions on the ride. To ensure your safety and that of others, we do have the following expectations of ride participants: </p> <p>- Cyclists are <b>required </b>to wear a correctly adjusted helmet. </p> <p>- Participants must sign a waiver including an emergency and/or home phone number. </p> <p>- Riders must cycle in a legal, safe, and courteous manner. Obey all traffic laws.  Practice good bike etiquette.  Use hand signals.</p> <p>- Never ride with earphones or ear bud(s).Pull off and stop when using a cell phone. </p> <p>- Participants should carry a pump, spare tube, patch kit, and money and know how to fix their own flats. Make sure to carry water and a snack as well.</p> <p>- Plan to arrive at least fifteen minutes before the start time with your bicycle ready to ride. This allows time to sign the waiver, listen to route instructions, meet the leader, and look at the map if available. </p> <p>- We also recommend that you print out the map for the ride you choose to do, if available from our website. </p> <p>For the group's enjoyment as well as your own, choose a ride at the pace and distance that matches your current ability.All participants are expected to be personally responsible for their own conduct and decisions while on an OUTspokin's ride.</p> <p>And above all else, HAVE FUN!</p> ",

Come join the group for a discussion of the book and then going to see the newly released movie. The location and times will change closer to the date as no movie times are yet available. This is a long book so posting with plenty of time!</p> <p>Check out the trailer: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/7no56Zw1e20\" class=\"embedded\">https://youtu.be/7no56Zw1e20</a></p> <p>Book Synopsis:</p> <p>A promise made twenty-eight years ago calls seven adults to reunite in Derry, Maine, where as teenagers they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city's children. Unsure that their Losers Club had vanquished the creature all those years ago, the seven had vowed to return to Derry if IT should ever reappear. Now, children are being murdered again and their repressed memories of that summer return as they prepare to do battle with the monster lurking in Derry's sewers once more.</p> ",

We start around 7:30 (no later than 7:40). We meet Mondays at Prana Yoga. Parking is in the back.   Please enter from the back alley.</p> <p>\"Our core guidance comes from the Pali Sutta’s, not from the Theravadan’s in Thailand, Burma or Sri Lanka nor the Mahayanan’s in Tibet, China or Japan. But from the oldest and most closely connected teachings to the Buddha. We do not have blind faith in doctrine, even within these documents there seems to be a lot of additional folklore, mythology and corruption of the Buddha’s Dharma.\"</p> <p>Against The Stream Buddhist Meditation Society is founded upon the empowering and self-revealed teaching of original Buddhism. We follow the guidance of the 4 Noble Truths. The Dharma (Truth) as revealed by the Buddha is our only Refuge. Through our founding teacher Noah Levine’s connection and empowerment from his teachers, Jack Kornfield, Stephen and Ondrea Levine and Ajahn Amaro we are directly connected to several lineages of traditional Buddhism that is linked through both the Theravada and Mahayana. Without the Ancients the Dharma would not have reached our shores, our ears and our hearts. So we honor all lineages and appreciate the good that is in all Buddhist traditions.  Our intention is simple- To make the teachings of the Buddha available to all who are interested. We wish only to create and sustain communities of healthy, accountable wise and compassionate people from every walk of life.

For example, the term \"machine learning\" is increasingly bandied about in corporate settings and cocktail parties, but what is it, really?</p> <p>In this session, James Weaver will give a gentle introduction to machine learning topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. He’ll also give you an overview of what you can achieve with machine learning, as well as an intuition on the maths behind it.</p> <p>The presenter is very aware that some material on machine learning can be maths-intensive, and off-putting if you are not confident with your calculus. Conversely, some material doesn’t go into enough detail so you don’t get a feel for how things actually work. This session will start right at the beginning with the basics, and build up in an approachable way to some of the most interesting techniques so you can get the most out of your machine learning adventure.</p> <p>\n\n<b>Kyle Dunn </b>Data is the new gold and platforms are an abundant source of this increasingly-important resource. This talk will demonstrate the immense value available from a reference architecture designed for surfacing proactive, cognitive-like capabilities from data in the logging systems. The tech stack consists of a transactional, in-memory layer coupled to an analytical data warehouse. The result: shorter developer debugging cycles, insights like \"What are the most common Java classes in my stack traces?\", and a dynamic, visual microservice dependency graph. Each of these examples serves to introduce powerful feedback into application and platform lifecycles, improving an organization's productivity, infrastructure resiliency, and even security.</p> <p><br/>Will discuss design patterns to enable business initiatives spanning streaming data, deep analytics, and reactive applications.  Google, Amazon, and Microsoft each have capitalized on their people and monetized their internal data to create \"public\" versions.  Learn how to replicate this approach in-house.  </p> <p><b>Bios</b>:</p> <p><b>James Weaver (@JavaFXpert): i</b>s a Java developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping Java to be increasingly leveraged in rich-client and and cloud-native applications.  James has written books including Inside Java, Beginning J2EE, the Pro JavaFX series, and Java with Raspberry Pi.  As an Advocate and Principal Technologist, James speaks internationally at software technology conferences about Java and Cloud Native development</p> <p><b>Kyle Dunn</b> works professionally as a Data Engineer for Pivotal Software, based in Denver, Colorado, USA. His professional background spans electric utility engineering, distributed systems/HPC, and more recently, RDBMS and data-driven workflows for enterprises.

They all have the ability to improvise in order to come up with powerful, innovative ideas—fast. </p> <p>While it can feel a bit risky in the moment, the best plans always include ample room for improvisation. Like a great improv troupe, successful businesses must rely on similar tools and values in order to succeed. </p> <p>This workshop will teach you how to tackle challenges—in business and in life—using improv comedy techniques proven to innovate ideas, solve problems and build better teams.</p> <p>\n\n\n<b> Takeaways From The Stage:</b></p> <p>• Learn how to apply tools to rapidly generate innovative ideas and solve problems </p> <p>• Provide actionable feedback on how to listen and communicate more successfully</p> <p>• Negotiate more effectively using “Yes, And”</p> <p>• Learn how to lead by creating an engaged environment for others</p> <p>\n\n\n\n<b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pitch-lab-how-to-use-improv-comedy-as-a-tool-for-innovation-tickets-36370715790?aff=Meetup\">REGISTER FOR THIS WORKSHOP!</a></b></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>About Your Instructors:</b></p> <p>RJ Owen:</p> <p>As a professional speaker, manager and event organizer, RJ Owen knows the value of a well-designed plan and the importance of not putting too much faith in it. RJ began his love of improv comedy as a child where he participated in local theater. As an adult, RJ was surprised to find that he could use those same skills for open and honest group imagination to help generate better ideas and unlock powerful insights. At home RJ is a parent of four children who are all quickly becoming better at improvising answers to normal questions like “why is this plant on fire?”</p> <p>\n\n\nJoel Lutz:</p> <p>Joel is a veteran improv comedian at MadCap Theatre by night and Senior Escalation Engineer at VMware by day, combining the seemingly disparate worlds of comedy and business to help the Denver startup scene find its funny. Also, a 6-year-old once told Joel he was the funniest person ever. And kids rarely lie.</p> <p><b><br/></b></p> <p><b><i>Want to learn more about RJ &amp; Joel? </i></b></p> <p><b>Here's <a href=\"http://www.pitchlab.io/pitch-lab-blog/2017/5/30/an-interview-with-pitch-labs-rj-owen-joel-lutz\">7 hard-hitting questions for our favorite improv coaches!</a></b></p> <p><br/><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/5/a/6/600_463981446.jpeg\" /></p> <p>\n\n\n<b>What Folks Are Saying About This Workshop!</b></p> <p>\n\n\n<i>\"I had no idea what to expect but absolutely loved the improv exercises. I've always been very public-speaking phobic and calculated in how I communicate, so I learned some great lessons for relaxing and being in the moment that I'll apply to work and life!\"</i>— <b>Rachel Richardson, Merkle </b></p> <p>\n\n\n<i>\"This was by far the most engaging and dynamic workshop I've been to.

For example, the term \"machine learning\" is increasingly bandied about in corporate settings and cocktail parties, but what is it, really?</p> <p>In this session, James Weaver will give a gentle introduction to machine learning topics such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, and deep learning. He’ll also give you an overview of what you can achieve with machine learning, as well as an intuition on the maths behind it.</p> <p>The presenter is very aware that some material on machine learning can be maths-intensive, and off-putting if you are not confident with your calculus. Conversely, some material doesn’t go into enough detail so you don’t get a feel for how things actually work. This session will start right at the beginning with the basics, and build up in an approachable way to some of the most interesting techniques so you can get the most out of your machine learning adventure.</p> <p><b>About James Weaver</b></p> <p>James Weaver is a Java developer, author, and speaker with a passion for helping Java to be increasingly leveraged in rich-client and and cloud-native applications.

    "description": "<p><b>Overview:</b> This inspiring panel event series invites key players in Denver’s design community to offer a rare insider’s look at how they work and create. From branding to user experience to city planning, panelists will discuss how they approach projects from a design point of view, how design thinking methods help with problem-solving, and much more. Plus, they’ll cover opportunities within the field and their vision for the future of the industry. Blurring the Lines between Branding and User Experience</p> <p><br/>We often think of a ‘brand’ as few key visual assets - a logo, color scheme, and style. In reality, a ‘brand’ is so much more. A ‘brand’ encompasses both visual assets and the consumers’ perception of a product or service.</p> <p>With so much of brand to consumer interactions happening online, the distance between branding and user experience design is rapidly decreasing.</p> <p>So, how does a brand intentionally surface its values within digital experiences? How can UX practices and principles help inform brand strategy? How can a brand stand out by doubling down on UX? Join us as we dive into the world of branding and how it’s being shaped by digital user experiences.</p> <p><b>Why It Matters:</b> Design is one of the most powerful forces in our lives. It affects our morning commute, how we experience websites and apps, and how we communicate with each other. Gaining a better understanding of this universal force will help you see the world and your projects through a fascinating new lens.</p> <p><b>Please RSVP at <a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/education/design-thinking-blurring-the-lines-between-branding-and-user-experience/denver/40741\" class=\"linkified\">https://generalassemb.ly/education/design-thinking-blurring-the-lines-between-branding-and-user-experience/denver/40741</a></b></p> ",

    "description": "<p>THE BOOKSELLER OF KABUL by Asne Seierstad gives us a first hand look at life few outsider have seen. Invited to live with Sultan Khan, a bookseller in Kabul, and his family for months, this account of her experience allows the Khans to speak for themselves, giving us a genuinely gripping and moving portrait of a family, and of a country of great cultural riches and extreme contradictions. For more than 20 years, Sultan Khan has defied the authorities--whether Communist or Taliban--to supply books to the people of Kabul. He has been arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned, and has watched illiterate Taliban soldiers burn piles of his books in the street. Yet he had persisted in his passion for books, shedding light in one of the world's darkest places. This is the intimate portrait of a man of principle and of his family--two wives, five children, and many relatives sharing a small four-room house in this war ravaged city, and is a rare look at contemporary life under Islam, where even after the Taliban's collapse, the women must submit to arranged marriages, polygamous husbands, and crippling limitations on their ability to travel, learn and communicate with others.</p> ",

You can see what your TensorFlow computation graph looks like graphed out, and you can ask for additional bits of data in your computation graph to be graphed out.</p> <p><br/>What have you learned that you want to share with everyone else? We want everyone to participate in learning and sharing what you've learned.</p> <p>We've got a new location: MSU Central Classroom 303 in Downtown Denver. Special thanks to Alex &amp; Gabriel for this location. To get directions, put the string \"Central Classroom, 10th Street, Denver, CO 80204\" into Google Maps and ask for directions. We got the room from 5pm but the meeting won't actually start until 6pm to give everyone time to arrive. Hopefully it will be easier to arrive at 6pm at this more central location (we were out in the boonies by the airport last time). So the plan is something like this:</p> <p><br/>5:00-6:00 Meet &amp; greet and share tips &amp; tricks</p> <p>6:00-7:00 Getting started with TensorBoard</p> <p>7:00-8:00 Study TensorFlow and deep learning in small groups</p> ",

    "description": "<p>You probably know that Denver’s population has increased rapidly over the past few years - by more than 93,000 since 2010, or a 15.5 percent increase to be exact - and this growth is symbolized by the more than 30 cranes dotting the city’s skyline (check out the DBJ’s crane watch map &lt;a&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).</p> <p>What does all this growth mean for our city and how we live?</p> <p>Different designers are likely to have different answers. Builders, architects, and city planners all play a part in how a city functions; UX Designers focus primarily on how people interact with products. While their day-to-day work may differ, the groups have a common goal of creating designs that are useful, easy to use, and delightful to interact with.</p> <p>On Thursday, September 14th, you’re invited to learn about the ways User Experience design principles can be applied to urban planning. APA Colorado, General Assembly, and Greystone Technology invite you to join us as we discuss:</p> <p>Opportunities for collaboration between planners and UX designersBalancing aesthetics with usability and the potential value for partnershipsThe ways technology and “smart cities” are influencing Denver right now</p> <p>There’s lots changing in Denver, and this interdisciplinary discussion is sure to highlight many exciting developments that are quickly becoming part of our daily lives, so come on out and learn more about how the digital world is shaping Denver!</p> <p>*Please RSVP at: <a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/education/tech-and-ux-urban-planning/denver/40632\" class=\"linkified\">https://generalassemb.ly/education/tech-and-ux-urban-planning/denver/40632</a></p> ",
